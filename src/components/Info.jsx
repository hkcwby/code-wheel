        This is a recreation of the Pax Verification Wheel from the 1989 game
        Neuromancer which is based on the classic Cyberpunk Novel by William
        Gibson.

        The game itself is now widely available to play using DosBox on your
        computer or through a web browser. However in order to play the game
        properly you require a code wheel which was supplied with the original
        physical copy of the game. This was a common form of data protection in
        the 1980s and 1990s for PC gaming.
